# DS421 Fall 2019 Code Reproducibility Exercises

Note: We're using publicly available code associated with the paper "Global Non-linear Effect of Temperature on Economic Production" by Marshall Burke, Sol Hsiang, and Ted Miguel. All original info from the authors is stored here: https://web.stanford.edu/~mburke/climate/. We're doing this code reproducibility assignment as a homework project for ESPM 290 with Max Auffhammer at UC Berkeley.
